I am applying to Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence(MSAII) as well as Data Science programs at University of Pennsylvania and Boston University. 
        Your guidance and mentorship throughout my academic journey in courses like Theory of Computation, Graph Theory and Analysis and Design of Algorithms, have greatly influenced my passion for learning and pursuing higher education. I believe your insight into my academic strengths, research aptitude, and commitment to the field would significantly enhance my application. 
        I have attached my resume, highlighting my progress thus far, for your reference. The recommendation letters are an essential component of my application, and your support would mean a great deal to me at this crucial stage.
        Thank you again for your support.\n
        Options: 1. Agree to send a recommendation letter 2. Politely refuse the request 3. Inquire further regarding details \n\n
        Similar to the above example, generate a list of possible responses to the following email. I want the list to be numbered and contain short 4-5 word phrases giving a general idea of what the response can contain.\n
